# Student Enrollment System

## Description

The Student Enrollment System manages student enrollments, courses, instructors, semesters, tests, grades, and academic programs.

In this application, administrators can create and manage departments and semesters. They can assign courses to semesters and instructors to courses. Administrators can also add students and instructors. Instructors are able to assign courses only from their respective departments to students. Additionally, instructors can create tests, add questions to tests, and manage multiple tests. Students can attempt these tests by providing answers, and instructors can grade the students upon test completion. Once all tests are completed, the final score for a course that the student is enrolled in for a particular semester is calculated as the average of all test scores.
